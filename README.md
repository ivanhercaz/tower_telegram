# TowerTelegram

Error tracking and reporting to a Telegram chat (group or channel).

It is a work-in-progress heavily inspired in the already existing
[`TowerEmail`][tower_email] structure,
but using Telegram and [`telegex` Telegram bot framework][telegex]

## Requirements

In order to use this reporter you must have a Telegram bot and provide
your bot token and the chat ID (group or channel) in which you need to
receive the reports.
